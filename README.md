This is the final assignment for the course Selected Topics in Mathematical Optimization. The goal is to implement an optimization method in Julia.

The folder- add a module to `src` with **at least one function**
- add at least one unit test to the folder `test`;
- document all your functions and add a page to the documentation page;
- make a notebook in [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) and add it to `notebooks`;
- perform a small code review of two other students.

This project is about finding negative cycles in graphs using the algorithm.
