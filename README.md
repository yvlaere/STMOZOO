# STMO-ZOO

This is the final assignment for the course Selected Topics in Mathematical Optimization. The goal is to implement an optimization method in Julia.

This project is about finding negative cycles in graphs using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

The `notebooks` folder contains a Pluto notebook containing all code for the project.
